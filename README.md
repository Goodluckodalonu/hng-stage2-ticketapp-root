# HNG Stage 2 – Multi-Framework Ticket App

This repository serves as the **root** for the **Stage 2 Ticket App** challenge, containing shared assets and links to all individual framework implementations.

---

## Project Overview

The **Ticket App** simulates a modern event ticketing interface.  
It has been implemented using **three different frameworks** — React, Vue, and Twig — to showcase cross-framework proficiency.

Each app includes:
- A responsive layout  
- Form validation  
- Ticket preview components  
- Dynamic user feedback  
- Shared assets (hero wave SVGs, circles, etc.)

## Shared Assets

This folder (`/assets`) contains reusable design elements used across all implementations.

**Files:**
- `hero-wave.svg`  
- `circle-large.svg`  
- `circle-small.svg`

These assets are imported into each frontend framework for consistent visuals.
